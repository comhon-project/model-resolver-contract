# Model Resolver Contract

Provide a basic contract that makes a bridge between application layer and any API by binding unique names and PHP classes.

You can find an example of implementation [here](https://github.com/comhon-project/model-resolver-contract/blob/main/tests/Resolver/ModelResolver.php)
